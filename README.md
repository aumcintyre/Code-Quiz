# Coding Quiz

## Purpose of the Password Generator

This coding quiz is designed to new developers easily learn coding terminology. It will prompt users with a start page, a "show highscores" button, and a timer. Once the start button is clicked, the first question will appear and the timer will add 15 seconds per question and begin counting down. Users must quickly answer questions before the time runs out, but they must also choose carefully. Every incorrect answer given will result in 30 seconds being removed from the timer. For each correct answer, no time is subtracted, and one point is added to the final total. Once the quiz is complete or the timer runs out, the user is presented with a form showing their total score and a box for the user to enter initials. Once intials have been entered, the score + initials will be recorded in local storage and will display on the leaderboard, in descending order.

## My Experience

This was definitely the biggest challenge so far in this course.  The start page, button, and timer were all pretty straightforward.
